#Jmtpfs

##Description

Jmtpfs is a FUSE and libmtp based filesystem for accessing MTP (Media Transfer
Protocol) devices. It was specifically designed for exchaning files between 
Linux (and Mac OS X) systems and newer Android devices that support MTP but not USB Mass 
Storage.

The goal is to create a well behaved filesystem, allowing tools like find and
rsync to work as expected. MTP file types are set automatically based on file
type detection using libmagic. Setting the file appears to be necessary for 
some Android apps, like  Gallery, to be able to find and use the files.
  
Since it is meant as an Android file transfer utility, and I don't have
any non-Android MTP devices to test with, playlists and other non-file
based data are not supported.

##Build & Installation

These are build directions for OSX

First install [osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/)

Then get Homebrew if you don't already have it.

`brew install` the following:

`libmtp`
`libusb`
`libmagic`

Then after `cd`ing to the cloned directory run

`./configure`

Hopefully there are no errors.

Then run `make`

And finally

`make install`

This will build the jmtpfs binary and place it in /usr/local/bin.

##Usage:

The way Fuse works is that it builds a virtual file system given a mountpoint (we will use a folder for this purpose)

Let's mount our device to the desktop.

To do this, create a folder called nexus (or whatever you like) inside your desktop (or someother place if you prefer).
You only have to do this once.

Next run

`jmtpfs -o local [path to created folder]`

Where [path to created folder] is replaced by the posix path.

For example: `jmtpfs -o local ~/Desktop/nexus`

The `-o local` flag creates a local mount so that it appears in the finder sidebar.

You can then access the files on the device as if it were a normal disk.

Passing the `-l` option will list the attached MTP devices.

You can then choose which device to mount with the `-device` option.

You can pass `-h` for help.

Unmounting can be done via the finder (eject) or via the osx standard umount

If you want to get really fancy you can add a name and icon:

`jmtpfs -o volname="Nexus 5" -o volicon=/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/com.apple.iphone-4-black.icns ~/Desktop/nexus`

Also downloadable (in the releases tab) is a helper application that will automatically run the above using a shell script upon launching the app. 

##Performance and implementation notes:

Libmtp (and I assume the MTP protocol itself) doesn't support seeking within a 
file or partial file reads or writes. You have to fetch or send the entire 
file. To simluate normal random access files, when a file is opened the entire
file contents are copied from the device to a temporary file. Reads and writes
then operate on the temporary file. When the file is closed (or if a flush or
fsync occurs) then if a write has occurred since the file was last opened the
entire contents of the temporary file are sent back to the device. This means
repeatedly opening a file, making a small change, and closing it again will
be very slow.

Renaming or moving a file is implemented by copying the file from the device, 
writing it back to the device under the new name, and then deleting the 
original file. This makes renames, especially for large files, slow. This
has special significance when using rsync to copy files to the device. Rsync
copies to a temporary file, and then when the copy is complete it renames the
temporary file to the real filename. So when rsyncing to a jmtpfs filessystem, 
for each file, the data gets copied to the device, read back, and then copied
to the device again. There is a true rename (but not move) supported by libmtp,
but this appears to confuse some Android apps, so I don't use it. Image files,
for example, will disappear from the Gallery if they're renamed.

Credits to @kiorky and @JasonFerrara for their work.

This is simply a rehost with some tweaks to the readme and include paths so that it is easier to understand and works out of the box with homebrew.
